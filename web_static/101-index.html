              Sun glances off a rock formation and slants through a pergola at
              this waterfront home on St. Martin's Simpson Bay Lagoon. The sea
              feels like it's lapping at the depths of the pool, and there's a
              sunny terrace the width of the home. A covered outdoor living area
              connects to the French country-inspired kitchen via bar. Follow
              the path to a dock on the lagoon or walk 300 meters to Baie Rouge
              beach. Waves lap at the shore, clouds skate across the sky—and it
              all unfolds right before this breezy St. Martin escape. Fronted by
              a shaded living and dining area designed to draw everyone out, the
              villa has a heated pool, too. Glass walls slide to reveal a
              wood-beamed great room. There's a ferry to nearby Pinel Island,
              but you can also take the villa's kayaks over. By car, it's 2
              minutes to the beach.
